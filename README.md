# Text-editor
Text editor using java language
Has we programmer use text editor in daily life.So that why i have chosen this project.
2.First i made a simple text editor with save,copy,cut and close.But has the day pass i started to add new things to this text editor such has open,save as and may more ,i made it similar to actual notepad that window have .
3.It has multiple feature and many Shortcut key that complete task way more easier.
4.I have to study about components of frame and what all element we can add in frame(Class in java) .There where many built in class such has Menubar,Button,Label and many more as that has to import from awt package.
5.There i use many other class that was to complete remaining task such has to Clipboard for copy,cut and paste .
6.ActionListener was use to give command to object so that it is further class that is inherited "actionPerformed",where action event get check by getSource() methods and accordingly the command get executed.
7.With ActionListener i have also use KeyListener. With inheriting all keyListener class such as key Typed ,KeyPressed and key Release.They are use has shortcut key that notepad has to make typing in my editor efficient and fast.
8.I have added many thing that was new such as you can access google or gmail which is essential for any person that want fast access to website and may more .
9.Their were many obstacle that i have to use different logic and some part even took more than a 1 weeks.Such has display of dialogbox and accept to whether to save or not .If file  already exist then dont show "saveDialog " and save it on the respective location after searching where that file was and it doesn't exist the show "saveDialog" to save to desired location.
10.It can very well detect where user is doing mistakes while saving and solve those mistakes.
11.It makes thing fast and efficient to work so that it has shortcut which in java is called “keylistener” (It is interface in java).
